			----------Interoduction-----------
In summary, the use of a ListIterator is advantageous when working with lists, especially doubly linked lists, due to its bidirectional traversal, support for efficient element modification, insertion capabilities, and the ability to retrieve index information. It enhances the versatility and efficiency of list manipulation in Java applications, offering a comprehensive set of features for tasks involving traversal and modification of list elements.


A ListIterator is a powerful tool in Java that provides enhanced capabilities for traversing and manipulating lists, especially doubly linked lists. It extends the functionality of the basic Iterator interface and is specifically designed for lists, allowing bidirectional traversal, modification of list elements during iteration, and retrieval of indices. 




			----------------working--------

	-----(ADD)----

	 ListIterator includes methods like add() which allow the insertion of new elements at any point during the iteration. This is particularly useful when building or restructuring lists on-the-fly, as it enables the seamless incorporation of elements without the need to restart the iteration from the beginning.

	---(REMOVE)------
	ListIterator is its support for element modification during iteration. Unlike the basic Iterator interface, a ListIterator provides methods such as set() and remove() that allow the modification and deletion of elements at the current position in the list. This flexibility is essential for scenarios where dynamic changes to the list are required while iterating, enabling efficient in-place modifications without the need for additional iterations.

------remove()--------
The remove() method is responsible for removing the current node from the list. It first checks if there is a current node (this.current != null). If true, it updates the next pointer of the previous node to skip the current node (this.current.prev.next = this.current.next) and the previous pointer of the next node to skip the current node (this.current.next.prev = this.current.prev). Finally, it moves the iterator to the next node, effectively removing the current node from the list.

-----   previous()   ---------
	Similarly, the previous() method facilitates backward traversal by retrieving the data of the previous element and moving the iterator to the previous node. It ensures there is a previous element using the hasPrevious() method, retrieves the data of the current node, moves the iterator to the previous node, and returns the retrieved data. This method is essential for navigating the list in reverse order.

----------next()--------
The next() method is responsible for moving the iterator to the next node in the list and returning the data of the current node. It first checks if there is a next element using the hasNext() method. If true, it retrieves the data of the current node (this.current.data), advances the iterator to the next node (this.current = this.current.next), and returns the retrieved data. This method is crucial for sequentially accessing and processing elements in the forward direction.

---------hasPrevious()------
Contrastingly, the hasPrevious() method serves a similar purpose but for backward traversal. It checks if there is another element in the backward direction by ensuring that both the current node (this.current) and its previous node (this.current.prev) are not null. If both conditions are satisfied, it indicates the presence of a previous element in the list.

-------hasNext()---------
The hasNext() method is designed to check whether there is another element in the forward direction of the doubly linked list. It examines if the current node (this.current) is not null. If this.current is not null, it indicates the presence of a next element in the list. This method is crucial for controlling the flow of iteration and is typically used in loop conditions to ensure that the iterator doesn't attempt to access elements beyond the end of the list.
